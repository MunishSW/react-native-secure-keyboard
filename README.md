# react-native-secure-keyboard

React Native Custom Secure Keyboard is a security-focused input framework designed to replace the default operating system keyboard with a fully controlled, in-app keyboard.It helps protect sensitive user data (PIN, password, MPIN, card details, OTP) from keylogging, clipboard attacks, predictive text leaks, and untrusted 3rd-party keyboards.

## Installation


```sh
npm install react-native-secure-keyboard
```


## Usage


```js
import { multiply } from 'react-native-secure-keyboard';

// ...

const result = await multiply(3, 7);
```
